# Portfolio-Project-1
Portfolio project - data analysis in Python. First Codecademy portfolio project.

# This file is a portfolio project by Deslea Selmes for the 
# Codecademy Pro Data Analysis Career Path. It is a limited-
# guidance project with basic defined outcomes (data extraction
# and analysis) of a provided csv dataset (pretty clean, no nulls),
# to be written in Python on your own environment (mine is VS Code).
# No starting code was provided, and no analysis questions - part
# of the task is to self-define questions/analysis tasks that may be
# of use to a client (who is not defined). The dataset contains 
# basic data about a set of customers of medical insurance.

# I have positioned this as a short analysis for a hypothetical 
# client, the marketing department. They intend to run a feelgood
# advertorial campaign providing quit-smoking resources to current
# and prospective customers. They want to know the impact of 
# quitting smoking on premiums, and also information to target
# the advertorials (smoking rates among, for instance, women
# with children) and regional variations.

# Much of this analysis would be better done in SQL but this was
# outside the parameters of the project.
